# Auto Chess
Simulates an Auto Chess game in C using the pthread library, where each thread is a player and elements that affect the results of the game, such as purchases and combat power, are randomly generated.

The Auto Chess was implemented as the final project for the course of Concurrent Programming (Programação Concorrente), lectured in the semester 2/2019 for the Computer Science degree.

# Compile and Execute
